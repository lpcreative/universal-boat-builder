# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs capture **why** we made key decisions, and what trade-offs were accepted.

## When to add an ADR
Add an ADR when a decision:
- changes the contract surface (ModelConfig, Rules DSL, compile pipeline)
- changes persistence rules (versioning, snapshots)
- changes the runtime architecture (engine boundaries, rendering pipeline)

## Template
Use the structure:
- Title
- Status (Proposed / Accepted / Superseded)
- Context
- Decision
- Consequences
- Alternatives considered
