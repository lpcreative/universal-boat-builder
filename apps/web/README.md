# apps/web — Builder UI

This app hosts the public-facing boat configurator:
- multi-step wizard rendering from compiled `ModelConfig`
- real-time pricing and validation
- client-side stacked layer rendering (profile/overhead)
- submission flow + PDF generation trigger (backend endpoints)

## Dependencies
- Runtime config artifacts generated by `packages/engine` compile pipeline
- Backend endpoints for submissions and final outputs (may be in the same Next.js app or separate API)

## Notes
Keep UI generic. Do not hardcode per-client logic; use config and rules only.
